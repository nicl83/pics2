# pics2
A Python script for hosting an image gallery.

This is an initial rough upload; figure out the dependencies yourself.

Image files and image album folders should be located in a folder named `pics` in the same directory as the script.

**DO NOT REMOVE ASSETS OR MAIN.CSS; THE CODE WILL BREAK VERY, VERY BADLY.**

Further instructions will be added tomorrow.
